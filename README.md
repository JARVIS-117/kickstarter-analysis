# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. By analyzing Kickstarter data of similar projects, future decisions may be able to be performed based on how those campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This analysis will provide those results and insights gathered along the way.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* For the time period being measured, the month of May has the largest number of successful campaigns and the ratio of successful vs failed campaigns. The two trailing months (June and July) also provided promising results when compared to the rest of the 12-month measurement period.

* The number of cancellations seem to be immaterial to this analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* Success/Fail rates for campaigns with goals between $15,000 - $19,999 are at parity (50/50). Success rates increase passed 50% at each goal interval as the funding requirements decrease with the first interval that has a positive success rate beginning at $10,000 - $14,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* The primary challenge that was experienced was when producing the Outcomes Based on Goals graph. The Mac version of Excel doesn’t readily have a filter option when building the graph like the Windows version does. This was circumvented
 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	- For the time period being measured, the month of May has the largest number of successful campaigns and the ratio of successful vs failed campaigns. The two trailing months (June and July) also provided promising results when compared to the rest of the 12-month measurement period.

	- Approaching year end through to December (which has the lowest number of successful campaigns), could be the time of year to focus on other initiatives instead of funding campaigns for theater projects such as plays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	- Don’t let your judgement to be clouded by the success rates (good or bad) found with campaign goal intervals beginning with $15,000 - $19,999 as the number of total projects is quite small when compared to those with lower crowd funding goals between $0 - $9,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	- While the dataset incorporates multiple years of data, it might be beneficial to drill down to the outcomes across specific years to observe how consistent our current findings are and consider the possibility of other economic factors (specific to those years) that might affect the outcomes as well.

	- As with any data with historical information such as those found via researching financial markets, historical information cannot guarantee the same outcomes.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	- Similar graphs and tables could be created that drill down to different locations to see if there is any value added for our analysis.

	- Creating tables or graphs that consider the number of backers for the projects may also be of benefit. Considering the average number of backers per project, projects with certain funding goals, and launch dates could also supplement our analysis. We might gain insight into the motivations backers might have when considering different variables that could lead to isolating marketing through specific avenues to reach funding goals more efficiently.
